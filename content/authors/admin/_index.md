I am a postdoctoral researcher at [HexHive](http://hexhive.epfl.ch/), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), advised by Prof. [Mathias Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/). I earned my Ph.D. with honour at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2024, advised by Prof. [Shouling Ji](http://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html). Prior to that, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree with honour at [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/) in 2018. 

I am broadly interested in software and system security, with a particular focus on IoT security. My recent research centers around developing innovative technologies to understand and mitigate risks in modern and emerging systems. This includes IoT messaging protocols, embedded systems, bootloader, OS kernels, and trusted execution environments. 
<!-- Additionally, I am exploring  vulnerability detection in autonomous driving and robotic systems, aiming to strengthen the security of critical technologies. -->
